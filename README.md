# Automobile Car Simulation Using Object Oriented Programming

## Goal of this project

The goal is to learn object oriented programming concepts in depth with hands-on experience.

## How it works

This is a simulation of a automobile car using C++ and it's OOP features. A car's initial positions will be given. Up, down, left, right buttons will simulate the rotations and speed increases. Go through the code to understand what's going on.

## How to run it

Run the `main.cpp` file and you will be prompted the next steps. Observe the outputs to know better.
